# Caine Phung

I’m a software developer based in Guelph, Ontario, and a recent graduate from Conestoga College’s Software Engineering Technology program, where I graduated with Distinction and completed 16 months of co-op experience.

At Equitable Life of Canada, I worked on both frontend and backend development. I helped build and maintain a React component library using MUI, replaced legacy VBScript jobs with C#, and supported deployment workflows using Azure DevOps and ActiveBatch.

Outside of work, I’ve built:
- A Chrome extension with a Node.js backend for automating daily tasks
- A modern e-commerce site using Next.js, CSS animations, and Sanity.io
- Contributed to a React Native capstone project with Firebase MFA, WebSocket-based chat, and Signal Protocol encryption

I enjoy working with Python, React, TypeScript, Node.js, Firebase, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, .NET, and Docker, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies.

## What I’ve Been Working On

### ASL Sign Language Learner
An AI-powered desktop app that teaches American Sign Language using real-time webcam input and hand landmark detection. Built with Python, MediaPipe, and TensorFlow, it includes live gesture recognition, feedback, and a lesson mode for practicing both static and motion-based ASL letters.

### NEAT Car AI  
Built a self-driving car simulation using NEAT and sensors. The car learns to navigate a custom track through raycast input, steering output, and a distance-based fitness function.

### NEAT Platformer AI  
Developed a 2D platformer where an evolving NEAT agent learns to move and jump across obstacles to reach a goal, using environment layout and player position as inputs and custom fitness logic to guide learning.
