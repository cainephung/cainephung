# Caine Phung

I’m a software developer based in Ontario and a recent graduate of Conestoga College’s Software Engineering Technology (Advanced Diploma, Co-op) program, where I graduated with Distinction and completed 16 months of co-op experience.

At Equitable Life of Canada, I worked on both frontend and backend systems. I helped build and maintain a React component library, replaced legacy VBScript jobs with C#, assisted with ASP.NET MVC and SQL Server projects, and supported deployment workflows using Azure DevOps and ActiveBatch.

Outside of work, I’ve built projects in cloud, AI/ML, and full-stack development, applying technologies like AWS Bedrock, FastAPI, PyTorch, MediaPipe, and Next.js.
